            <h1>CANCER</h1>

            </div>
            <p><h4>Definition</h4>
                Cancer is not just one disease, but a large group of almost 100 diseases. Its two main characteristics are uncontrolled growth of the cells in the human body and the ability of these cells to migrate from the original site and spread to distant sites. If the spread is not controlled, cancer can result in death.
                <h4>Description</h4>
                One out of every four deaths in the United States is from cancer. It is second only to heart disease as a cause of death in the states. About 1.2 million Americans are diagnosed with cancer annually; more than 500,000 die of cancer annually.
                Cancer can attack anyone. Since the occurrence of cancer increases as individuals age, most of the cases are seen in adults, middle-aged or older.
                 Sixty percent of all cancers are diagnosed in people who are older than 65 years of age. 
                The most common cancers are skin cancer, lung cancer, colon cancer, breast cancer (in women), and prostate cancer (in men). 
                In addition, cancer of the kidneys, ovaries, uterus, pancreas, bladder, rectum, and blood and lymph node cancer (leukemias and lymphomas) are also included among the 12 major cancers that affect most Americans.
                Cancer, by definition, is a disease of the genes. A gene is a small part of DNA, which is the master molecule of the cell. Genes make "proteins," which are the ultimate workhorses of the cells.
                 It is these proteins that allow our bodies to carry out all the many processes that permit us to breathe, think, move, etc. <a href="https://www.bing.com/ck/a?!&&p=af793e54080221c1JmltdHM9MTY5OTkyMDAwMCZpZ3VpZD0zNjlhYTg2ZS0yMmFmLTZlNmItMWQ4NS1iYmE2MjM2MzZmZTgmaW5zaWQ9NjM5MQ&ptn=3&ver=2&hsh=3&fclid=369aa86e-22af-6e6b-1d85-bba623636fe8&u=a1aHR0cHM6Ly9tZWRpY2FsLWRpY3Rpb25hcnkudGhlZnJlZWRpY3Rpb25hcnkuY29tL2NhbmNlcg&ntb=1">Cancer</a>...</p>

            <p><span style="font-size: 30px; padding-left: 15px;">Call of Duty</span> is a video game series and media franchise published by Activision, starting in 2003. The games were first developed by Infinity Ward, then by Treyarch and Sledgehammer Games. Several spin-off and handheld games were made by other developers. The most recent title, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III, was released on November 10, 2023. 
                The series originally focused on the World War II setting, with Infinity Ward developing Call of Duty (2003) and Call of Duty 2 (2005) and Treyarch developing Call of Duty 3 (2006). Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare (2007) introduced a modern setting, and proved to be the breakthrough title for the series, creating the Modern Warfare sub-series; a Modern Warfare remastered version released in 2016. Two other entries, Modern Warfare 2 (2009) and Modern Warfare 3 (2011), were made. 
                The sub-series received a reboot with Modern Warfare in 2019, Modern Warfare II in 2022, and Modern Warfare III in 2023. Infinity Ward have also developed two games outside of the Modern Warfare sub-series, Ghosts (2013) and Infinite Warfare (2016). 
                Treyarch made one last World War II-based game, World at War (2008), before releasing Black Ops (2010) and subsequently creating the Black Ops sub-series. Four other entries, Black Ops II (2012), Black Ops III (2015), Black Ops 4 (2018), and Cold War (2020) were made, the latter in conjunction with Raven Software. Sledgehammer Games, who were co-developers for Modern Warfare 3, have also developed three titles,
                Advanced Warfare (2014), Call of Duty: WWII (2017), and Vanguard (2021). 
                They are also the lead developer for Modern Warfare III (2023), the third entry in the Modern Warfare reboot sub-series. Read more about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_of_Duty">CALL OF DUTY</a> </p>
